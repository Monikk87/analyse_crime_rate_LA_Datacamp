### Support the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) by analyzing crime data to identify patterns in criminal behavior


### Problem description:
Known for its warm weather, palm trees, sprawling coastline, and Hollywood, along with producing some of the most iconic films and songs. However, as with any highly populated city, it isn't always glamorous and there can be a large volume of crime. That's where you can help!

You have been asked to support the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) by analyzing crime data to identify patterns in criminal behavior. They plan to use your insights to allocate resources effectively to tackle various crimes in different areas.


### Data 
An overview of the data set is attached to this repo.


### Motivation
Via this project I wanted to practice my data analysis skills. This was one of the first projects that I picked up in Datacamp
  

### Thought process
- I explored the dataframe and splitted the hours from the datetime column
- I defined two functions for counting crimes and visualising the results due to repetition
- I calculated and visualised the hour with the highest crime rate
- I identified and visualised the area with the highest nightly crime rate
- I identified and visualised the age group with the highest crime rate
